# Extend GiveWP

## Purpose

This plugin extends the <a href="https://givewp.com">GiveWP donation plugin</a> by: 

(1) setting an option in the WordPress database to store and retrieve the featured image post ID displayed in the Give donation form;

(2) registering custom functions to the GiveWP plugin to render additional labels, content blocks, and a captioned featured image; and 

(3) registering `extend-give-wp` with the Custom module of the `central-hub` must-use plugin to flush the rewrite rules on plugin status change ( e.g. activation, deactivation, uninstall );

This plugin's structure is modeled on the <a href="https://github.com/KnowTheCode/Sandbox-Workspace">`Sandbox-Workspace` plugin,</a> which is also available from the <a href="https://github.com/KnowTheCode">KnowtheCode.io code repository on GitHub.com</a>.

## Application

The plugin is currently in use on the <a href="https://cornerstonechorale.org">Cornerstone Chorale & Brass website.</a>
It's also under version control in the <a href="https://github.com/rgadon107/extend-give-wp">`'extend-give-wp'`</a> repository on 
Github.com.
